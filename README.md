## About

The **PFDA-assignments** repository holds the code and necessary files for the assignments completed as part of the **Programming for Data Analytics** course. The assignments involve applying programming techniques to analyze datasets and develop solutions based on provided tasks.

## Files and Structure

The repository includes the following files and structure:

- `data/`: A folder containing the datasets used in the assignments.
- `assignment_2_weather.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that includes a plot visualizing temperature over time.
- `assignment_3_pie.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that includes a pie chart visualizing data distribution.
- `assignment_5_risk.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for analyzing and simulating the Risk game and plotting some results.
- `assingment_6_weather.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for analyzing and visualizing weather data, such as temperature and wind.
- `.gitignore`: A file to specify which files and directories should not be tracked by Git.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The assignments may require specific Python libraries, which can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file if available.

You may also need a tool like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or a Python IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) to run the code.

## Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomUszyn/PFDA-assignments.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PFDA-assignments

3. Install any necessary dependencies (if a requirements.txt file exists):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Code

### Option 1: Running the Notebook in Jupyter

Since the code is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files), you can run them using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow these instructions to get started:

1. Install Jupyter: If you don't already have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    * Navigate to the directory where the notebook file is located.
    * Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
3. Launch the notebook:
    * A browser window will open. Click on the desired .ipynb file (e.g., assignment_2_weather.ipynb).
    * You can now execute the code cells interactively by selecting a cell and clicking the "Run" button or pressing Shift + Enter.

### Option 2: Running the Code in VS Code

You can also run Jupyter Notebooks in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, which is a powerful code editor with great support for Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
If you don't have VS Code installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Install the Python Extension
After installing VS Code, you need to install the Python extension and the Jupyter extension to enable notebook support:

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **Python** and install it.
4. Search for **Jupyter** and install it as well.

### Step 3: Open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code
1. Open VS Code and navigate to the folder where your notebook is located.
2. You can open the notebook directly from the **File Explorer** in VS Code. Simply click on the `.ipynb` file (e.g., `assignment_1.ipynb`), and it will open in a Jupyter Notebook interface within VS Code.

### Step 4: Running the Notebook
Once your notebook is open, you can run it just like in Jupyter Notebooks:

- Youâ€™ll see a **toolbar** above the notebook cells with a "Run" button. You can use this to run individual cells.
- To run a cell, select it and press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button.

### Step 5: Working with Virtual Environments (Optional)
If your project uses a specific virtual environment (for example, `conda`), you can set it up in VS Code:

1. Make sure the virtual environment is activated.
2. Select your environment by clicking on the **Python version** in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window and selecting the appropriate interpreter.
